Business Fundamentals - Project 3


Background/goal

In the project I will try to get hired to an online wealth management company called Nutmeg. The company has good reviews on Trustpilot, which shows that the clients are satiisfied with the products but the bad reviews are all about the poor customer service the clients received. Many customer shared that they transferred their savings after the company provided such a bad service.

The goal of the project to recommend solution, how to improve their customer service to reduce the number of unsatisfied customers.


Data

In the project I will analysis a fiction dataset of data center calls (downloaded from kaggle) to show what metrics they could calculate from similar dataset and what to focus on. Additional I will go truth other solution paths that are available to improve on that area.


Tools

I will use Sheets to store, manipulate and visualise data and the results of the analysis.
